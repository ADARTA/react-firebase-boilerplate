## Adding in Firebase and restructuring some of the Scaffolding

React Firebase Boilerplate is a work in progress for ADARTA Inc.  
It was agreed to release as an open source repository to give back to the community.
It should work out of the box for your organization/personal use, but consider it may be opinionated in some of the practices it uses.

## Highlights

- **Firebase**: Thanks to the Firebase team for all they have done. We feel this is one of the most important additions we can make.
